# House Bid
Scraping the ESPC website for historical house price data. This scraper helped me choose a bid price that was statistically likely to succeed.

## Artifacts

### Text

`data` 
This directory contains the individual html search pages to be scraped by the scraper. I did not hit the ESPC website directly as the search required handling tokens, and I needed the data quickly.

`ouput`
This directory contains the output generated by program when run on the files contained in data. Old iterations of the scraper created multiple download files, the new one creates a single file. The file 'data.xlsx' contains the latest run of the scraper.

`parse.py`
The scraper application written in Python.
